In conclusion, it's important to consider that the average price for homes is influenced by various factors, including location, market conditions, property characteristics, and other variables. The provided data does not indicate a direct relationship between the year of construction and the average price for this specific subset of homes. Other factors, such as changes in market demand, economic conditions, and specific property attributes, could have a more significant impact on the average prices observed in the dataset.

Based on the runtime of the original data, cached data and parquet formatted data, parquet formatted data demonstrates the best runtime among the three options. The Parquet data format is indeed optimised for efficient processing and can provide better performance compared to other file formats like CSV or JSON, especially when dealing with large datasets. However, the runtime of a query can be influenced by various factors, including the size of the dataset, the complexity of the query, the available system resources, and the specific operations being performed. Additionally, runtime performance can vary depending on the specific dataset, hardware configuration, and the execution environment.
